# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the linter, and looks for any code style warnings or errors - the linter is automatically ran if the server is running and will prevent the app from being run if there are code style errors.

### `npm run lint:fix` 

Attempts to auto fix any linter issues - may not be able to fix all. Primarily used to fix issues dealing with quotes, end of line semicolons, end of line commas.

### `npm run format` 

Will format all files to follow the linter style guides - primarily used to autofix issue regarding spacing, tabs, line indentation.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
